scPipe-ATAC is an R package that contains capabilities of pre-processing scATAC-Seq data through scPipe. 
This package allows barcode demultiplexing, peak calling and quality control of raw sequencing data generated by multiple single-cell ATAC-Seq sequencing protocols including 
10X, scATAC-Seq, dscATAC-Seq, dsciATAC-Seq, sciATAC-Seq, plate-based ATAC-Seq and scHTS-Seq.
scPipe-ATAC produces a feature-barcode count matrix that is essential for downstream analysis along with a user-friendly HTML report that summarises data quality. 
These results can be used as input for downstream analyses including normalization, visualization and statistical testing.

The package is under active development. Feel free to ask any questions or submit a pull request.

* [22/05/2020] scPipe-ATAC will be finally integrated as a scATAC-Seq pre-processing module within scPipe
