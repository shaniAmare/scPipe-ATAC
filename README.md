scPipe-ATAC is an R package that contains capabilities of pre-processing scATAC-Seq data through [scPipe] (https://github.com/LuyiTian/scPipe). 
This package allows barcode demultiplexing, peak calling and quality control of raw sequencing data generated by multiple single-cell ATAC-Seq sequencing protocols including 
10X, scATAC-Seq, dscATAC-Seq, dsciATAC-Seq, sciATAC-Seq, plate-based ATAC-Seq and scHTS-Seq.

scPipe-ATAC produces a feature-barcode count matrix that is essential for downstream analysis along with a user-friendly HTML report that summarises data quality. 
These results can be used as input for downstream analyses including normalization, visualization and statistical testing, through a *Single Cell Experiment* object.

**The package is under active development. There can be a lot of bugs if you try to run this version. So please stay tuned here for a more complete version. Yet, you are very welcome to try and ask any questions or submit a pull request. I suggest using the approach in [process file](./process.R)**

The plan is to integrate fully functional scPipe-ATAC functions with the exisiting scPipe package and allow routine maintanance to happen there.

* [20/07/2020] scPipe-ATAC submitted as a poster to BioC2020 virtual conference
* [12/07/2020] incorporate bedtools2 to generate feature matrix
* [28/06/2020] incorporate macs2 to call peaks
* [20/06/2020] extend sc_trim_barcode() to generate the CB:Z: column from the BAM file
* [02/06/2020] scPipe-ATAC demultiplexing step completed; 0.4 seconds to process a 6MB of paired-end fastq reads
* [13/05/2020] initiate scPipe-ATAC repository on GitHub
